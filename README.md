## Ideology

I believe in keeping the frontend as loght as possible, which is why I believe in writing code from scratch as much as possible instead of uitlizing libraries and more dependencies. This aids in making sure user experience is top-notch and the app is not too heavy on the client. Most of the components were created with normal Javascript code as pooosed to node libraries.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React Typescript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
